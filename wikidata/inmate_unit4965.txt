It's been a while.

It's a robot.

Unit 4965 is a Humanoid Construction Chassis. It was built way the hell back. So far back that it sorta remembers the first extra-solar voyage. It's done its job since then. It's designed for construction, so it builds. And does the occasional demolitions work. When it's line of Chassis components went out of business, it didn't quietly go to a nearby recycling plant. It instead quietly manufactured 'accidents' in order to requisition parts that it would need to continue functioning. It upgraded itself when it could, never getting caught, no one knowing that the strange Chassis on the side of a nearby ship was anything more then an oddly designed Construction Chassis. And they still didn't think anything was off about its design when it de orbited a military space station with a creatively applied modular torch.
====
Survival is key. Building is key. Beyond that, there is naught but amusement at life, and smugness at a job well done.
====
Unappreciated creativity when performing unsanctioned demolition of annoying military assets.
