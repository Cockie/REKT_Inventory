Dak Perkins grew up having a rough start to life. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised by a mercenary group as one of their own. He was raised to handle firearms and taught tactics so that he could join them when he became old enough. When Dak turned 18, he was cleared to go on missions, and when he turned 20, he began leading them. It seemed as if he was destined to rule the group one day until he made a grave error. While in the middle of a civil war conflict, Dak was caught by a grenade blast and left disoriented. Several government soldiers and fellow mercenaries came to assist him but he gunned them down while still concussed, acting on adrenaline and instinct. Despite many in the group seeing both sides of the situation, there were too many negatives against him and the allied government was planning on having him executed in accordance to their...'just' laws. Rather than risk the group coming into conflict with the government, Dak was handed over to the Tartarus.
====
Dak was raised to follow orders and give them if no one else was up to the task. He tends to keep chatter to a minimum during missions and talk plenty after them. A soldier who knows that teamwork can make or break a mission. Always learning new things in order to be the best, as he was raised to be. Avoids talking about why he got sent to the Tartarus.
====
Dak killed some people by accident and was going to be sentenced to death by heathen laws.
