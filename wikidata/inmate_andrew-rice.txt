Andrew was born into a rich Core World family that owned a small luxury cruiser line. It was always his dream to captain one of the giant vessels owned by his family. However, when his father allowed him to take one for a spin- with passengers- the reactor went critical from lack of maintenance...a situation made worse by Andrew's bumbling attempts to contain the catastrophe. By the end of the day, the liner was a clump of irradiated slag, 500 passengers were dead, and Andrew was on his way to the Outer Rim to escape his family's anger. Unfortunately for him, the Tartarus caught up with him one day...

Easy-going and friendly, once you get to know him. He is very quiet otherwise. He seems to genuinely feel bad for his actions and wants to atone. 

Mission 2 did little to endear REKT to him, given that he lost his leg practically the second he left his ship, but it has shown him that most of his comrades aren't the bloodthirsty, backstabbing cowards everyone in the Core made people like them out to be.
++ Personal Relations
Feels something of a kinship with Fallen, since they were the only two survivors of their squad. 
Likes Kai'isha quite a lot thanks to her saving his life- her personality helps in this.

Accidentally caused 500 passengers to die while they were under his care.
