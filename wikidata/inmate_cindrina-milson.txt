Cindrina is described as having long, dark hair that she brushes in front of her eyes as if she's trying to hide. She carries a photo album with her. Formerly a nurse on Cissinia, sister to a herbalist, [[[inmate:Ama'lia Milson]]]. Cindrina had a very happy, peaceful, normal life until her sister Ama'lia Milson was arrested and sent to Tartarus for reasons unknown to her. She saved up money, paid Tartarus's fee, and shipped herself to Tartarus as well. Upon learning her sister had joined REKT, Cindrina followed suit.
====
Brave, but tends to get herself into stupid situations, and then grows quite cowardly. This all conflicts with how shy she is. She tends to regret her decisions later. She is also loyal to a fault. A kind-hearted soul, she would go out of her way to help others even if it meant sacrificing herself.
====
She paid her way into it. She never did anything remotely related to criminal activity.
