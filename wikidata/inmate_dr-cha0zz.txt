Grew up in a poor family and was beaten by his parents. Bullied at age 6-12 until he took revenge by electrifying the bullies brain. Went to university at the age of 16 and proved to be one of the best students, during his time at university, different mysterieus disappearings and explosions happened, but this could not be linked back to him. After graduation he started a drugs lab to sell his self invented drugs. Because just selling drugs is boring, he also started making powerfull explosives and sold them to terrorists. 

Dr. Cha0zz likes classical music, preferably from german composers (Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, etc).
He also likes science and thus tries to approach situations from a scientific and strategic point of view.

Dr. Cha0zz is a slender 42 year old male.
He has brown hair, when he's not wearing his lab coat, he can be seen in a classic brown tailor made suit with a tie.
====
Unstable, not easily scared.
He hates bullies.
Subject to sudden mood changes.
Has the tendency to look down on others, calling them idiots. If however he meets someone new, he initially is neutral about that person but he quickly forms an opinion.
He has respect for fellow scientists.
The help of others and his close to death experiences in mission 2 have humbled Dr.Cha0zz, while he will still hate idiots he will be nicer to the people he doesn't consider idiots and he won't call you an idiot as quickly as he did previously.
