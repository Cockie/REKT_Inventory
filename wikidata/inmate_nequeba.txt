I had a rough childhood if you could call it that. I sort of just got abandoned by my parents, I think they died. I was really young. I was found by a guy who took kids and sort of abused them as a labor force. Not really sure what happened there, I ran away pretty quickly and realized that the best way to survive on the world I lived on was just to slip into the shadows and do whatever came naturally. For me of course that just so happened to be eyeing valuable artifacts and acquiring them in whatever way happened to be available at the time. A couple of assisted suicides happened that way. Of course the last time didn't go so well, I was just sort of trying to do a job for a friend, he wanted another "friend" taken care of. I didn't know that the plant fertilizer that was stored with the food was highly explosive.

What is there to say? I love new people, but I don't get attached. I'll do anything for a price.

What do you think after reading the personal information? I kinda blew up an entire storage area which just so happened to contain about half of our planets food sources which resulted in a massive starvationâ€¦
