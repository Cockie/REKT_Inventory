Lugg was born on New Earth and moved to Ctoba IX early in his life. He abandoned his last name in his childhood and simply went by "Lugg", or "Lugg D" if necessary. During the next couple of decades, he made a living in a drug dealership that manufactured and sold a highly addictive version of Whiff to buyers on the inner worlds. After that particular business venture failed, Lugg set himself up as a mercenary. For the next decade, he served as a combination hitman, bodyguard, and bouncer. If you were going to sell drugs in a shady locale, he was the kind of man you'd want to hire. If someone didn't pay their debts, Lugg was who you would send to collect. If someone showed up at your doorstep and you didn't want them around, Lugg was there to take them out.
====
Laid back and cool, calm in most situations. Takes a lot to make him blow up on people. Quiet, and speaks in a deep voice. People tend to listen to him; he speaks with a voice of wisdom.
====
Unknowingly killed a number of undercover policemen.
