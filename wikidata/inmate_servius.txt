Recently made Praetor on Res Publica on his homeworld of U-235. His older brother, now deceased inmate Tulius, was one of the top scientists, who would inadvertently cause the planets destruction. He happened to be space-bound for a final covert ops mission with his team when U-235 was consumed by nuclear fire. Servius is one the best warriors U-235 ever produced, though in his current state is severely diminished.
====
Charismatic and physically dominating. Tends towards not using his charisma to manipulate people, but will if necessary. Highest marks in Hand to Hand/Melee Combat. 
====
After watching his homeworld burn in atomic fire, his personality took a dark dive, and he fled toward the nearest Mega-Tropolis. At one point, got into a fight and proceeded to kill most of the entire block during the ensuing melee.
