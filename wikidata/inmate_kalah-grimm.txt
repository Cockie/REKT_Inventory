Kalah grew up in a busy Mid-Rim Metropolis that was plagued by an unprecedented crime rate. It was inevitable, then, that she ran afoul of a powerful mafia. Deciding that she rather enjoyed breathing, and life in general, Kalah cut a deal with the police. Their protection for her information. It sparked a street war that lasted well over a year, only blind luck and street-smarts kept Kalah from meeting her creators. Eventually she decided to join the police and had all the makings of a stunning police officer. Her career came to an abrupt and screeching end after a night of heavy drinking. She has sworn off alcohol since.
