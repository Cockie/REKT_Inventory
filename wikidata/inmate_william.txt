Formerly a commander of an entire platoon in the military of a god-forsaken dust ball in the middle of nowhere, William is not the person he used to be. He was ordered to abandon the civilian convoy he was escorting to protect a military base that was under attack by a rival system, but refused. Almost single-handedly he saved the convoy and it’s 20,000 people, but the military base was destroyed. Fellow-soldiers, angry at his disobedience that cost them many comrades, chose not to assassinate him. Instead, they tortured and killed his family, his girlfriend, and several other friends, then got him put on the Tartarus, which was the only official bit. They figured, quite correctly, that living with that much loss due to his decision would be much more painful than death. Now he is no longer a friendly, charismatic figure. Angered that trying to protect civilians – what he views as the military’s duty – got so many people he loved killed, he has vowed never to grow attached to anyone ever again. He completely lost his faith in humanity, and has contemplated suicide several times, but deemed it not worth ridding other people of his annoying presence. He is an excellent pilot, and agile, strong, and accurate on the ground. His main weakness is a complete ineptitude around all things robotic psi or unusual. He mainly likes simple he can understand. Anything he can’t understand frustrates him, which is like frustrating a rattlesnake wrapped around your neck while hanging upside down from a tree. He was nicknamed “Quackshot” by the instructors at the training facility, who were charmed by both his accurate shooting and flying, and his obsession with anseriform poultry.

Biological information: Standing 5 feet 6 inches, William is built very stockily and has been known to bend crowbars with his bare hands out of sheer boredom. He is capable of fast, accurate movements. He has developed a permanent glaring scowl calculated to annoy people. His clenched muscles and tight, choppy movements denote his contained rage.

Not friendly. Prone to displays of rage, yet it never really gets out of control, aka he might yell a lot and bang things, but never actually hurts anyone or breaks anything, despite his strength. Also, he never cusses, which is strange at times. Somewhere deep inside him is the remnant of the kindly person he once was. If someone can repeatedly prove himself to be rock-reliable, William may show a little of his nice side, which is made slightly creepy by the contrast with his normal behavior. Unlike anyone else, he feels a strange affinity to SCAMPS.
====
Disobeying an order to abandon a convoy and defend military assets, despite the number of people in the convoy being ten times greater than that of the station.
