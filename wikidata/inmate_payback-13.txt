Male
====
Payback-13 suffers from amnesia, with no real knowledge of how he got here or where he came from. He knows his name and how to fight, CQC and small firearms use is so familiar it's comparable to knowing how to breath when organics are born.... Breathing, what is that anyway? A useless function, that's what.
====
Quiet, but sarcastic in nature. Payback-13 has a distrust of most intelligent organic life. Especially after waking up on this damned ship, his ultimate motivation is vengeance and he will find whatever means to exact it. If something is useful to him, he will protect it. All previous memories unknown, past experiences null.
====
After attempting to access the information on his thirteenth memory wipe Payback-13 has been unable to ascertain the reason why.
