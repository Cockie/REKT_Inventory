Optimistic yet cautious young space pilot, has seen a lot of ups and downs for his relatively young age including being uncloaked by a retreating ally and then destroyed. It didn't help that said ally was under his control either... He was born on a small colony in a core system and spent three years learning and gradually gaining enough skill and knowledge to make it on his own, which didn't end up working out anyway.

Blake died at the end of the second REKT mission. Through all of his near-death experiences he never once actually died, and it has affected him for the better. Realising the severity of his situation, he has resolved to become stronger and more willful. He will survive and if he is to be killed or captured he sure as hell won't let them get away unscathed.

====
Kind and optimistic but also cautious and vengeful. Loves cats and reptiles. Also loves to tell stories about his adventures and many many near death experiences. Unemotional during events, however prone to emotion issues afterwards.
====
Accidentally ejected a nuclear device into a trade station in a moment of panic during a pirate attack. Destroyed $22.32 trillion worth of materials, goods and structures.
