+ 78% complete pre-mission, 15% complete total
__Wiki__
* Miscellaneous (WHAT? THIS HELLISH NIGHTMARE EVENTUALLY ENDS?!)
 * Play Stellaris (OMG IT DOES! OH YES! YES! PLEASE!)
 * Relax (SO MUCH YES, OMG I LOVE YOU)
 * [[[stat:Durability]]] needs fainting rules for cyborgs, androids and cymeks (doesn't have to be done before mission, though I would like to know before I start losing legs :V ~Dino )
 * --Write a page on the layer system so Dino can write the Program of Legendsâ„¢-- (done, I'll ask for clarifications where needed ~Dino)
 * Read the [http://forums.ltheory.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=4933 Character Stories], take notes and decide what's canon and what's not, or something.
 * Go through [http://forums.ltheory.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=4692&start=240#p126791 new armory suggestions] every now and often
 * Specify recharge time (in turns or layers) for energy based weapons (for the same reason)
 * Add other armoury things: (NEVERMIND, SCREW YOU, YOU'RE EVIL) (>:D ~Dino)
  * Atomic Hammer
  * Tank Drone
  * Combot
  * CERNIN
  * Replace infantry respec with mech suit (Corn also had [http://forums.ltheory.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=4692&start=135#p119803 a thing] about the mech thing, this should prolly be in before mission 3 since Corn wants one)
  * Ship specialisation (can wait, don't think anyone wants/can afford this right now)
  * [[[equip:High Tier Weapons CraftKit]]]
  * [[[equip:High Tier Weapons PartKit]]]
  * rebalance high tier kit prices (can wait)
 * Ponder over the stuff in [[[http://lt-rekt.wikidot.com/armory-to-add-list#toc36 | "Maybe"]]] and add or remove as needed
 * Make a correct version of the tree on [[[alien abilities]]] there was something wrong with 6 and 7 of tier 2 iirc
 * Go through all infantry weapons and add armor penetration to the ones that are lacking it (people can just ask you about the ones they're interested in for now and we can add one by one)
 * Fix [[[equip:Blunderbuss]]] - add new fun stuff, remove old dumb stuff ((have looked it over and decided that I can't really think of anything else to add just yet, and outlander's insta-stick globs need heavily balanced anyway because they're basically a one-shot-kill god weapon at the moment ~Tal)) ((okay, we have enough fun stuff for it now anyway
* Patreon stuff:
 * We need a thread about Warp drives and their lore (Silverware)
 * we need to fill out the technology page(s)? (Cha0zz)
 * --Need more work on the Mimir Corporation page (Charley)--
 * --Need to give Victor his own major character page (Victor)--
 * --Whatever you feel like :V if you're starved for ideas, perhaps Tartarus history? If that's not too much spoilers (~Dino)--
 * I owe you guys pictures. GIVE ME PICTURE SUGGESTIONS SO I KNOW WHAT TO MAKE
  * --A credit token (Charley? don't remember)--
  * How about nice renders of the HAMMER and/or ShieldMaiden and/or Carrier? I know you have the models, but the renders we have I had to cut out of some image I found on your imgur and are kinda lo-res and tiny (or non-existant for the HAMMER) (~Dino)  
  * Some stuff on the  technology needs pictures (HAMMER, boarbear?, quantum mini-turret, quantum minidrone) (~Cha0zz)
  * Maybe it would be cool if we also started to add models for the weapons? (~Cha0zz)
