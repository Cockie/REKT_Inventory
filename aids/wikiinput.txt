  * [[[stat:Durability]]] needs fainting rules for cyborgs, androids and cymeks [http://forums.ltheory.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&p=127249#p127240 discussion thread]
  * --[[[stat:PSI]]] needs a look at the fainting/shock/panic rules: 3-6 is ambiguous (in the first table it seems to exclude 3 and 6, in the second table 3-5 includes 3 and 5). And it's literally impossible to faint, since you add at most +3 to a level that cannot be higher than 4, which can't give 8. I wrote a quick program to simulate it, it's on dropbox in the REKT inventory folder as shock.py.--
  * --Multi-roll for scanning stuff with the pda, proposed suggestions:--
   * --PDA is a "bonus weapon" you can do all your weapon rolls and take one scan, once you start taking more than one scan it eats away from your weapons actions.--
   * --PDA works as a weapon, from the moment you do a scan it eats away from your weapon actions, no "free" scans.--
   * --Amount of scans that can be done per turn is dependent on the robotics skill.--
   * --Advanced PDA that lets you do more than one scan if you buy it.--
  * --Multi-roll for to-buy infantry tools (like medkits): if you buy x of them, can you use them x times per turn? (1 use for each item you've bought per turn)-- no
  * --Clarify armour rules in--
   * --[[[equip:Light suit armor]]]--
   * --[[[equip:Heavy Suit armor]]]--
   * --[[[equip:Armored Bodypart]]] (I copied it over from light armour, but a) check that b) the description says "can take a bullet swarm", prolly not accurate :p)--
  * --Clarify armour penetration of infantry weapons (e.g. the [[[equip:assault rifle]]] says it's not good against armour yet penetrated light armour with ease in VR): I made a guesstimate on basis of your armor description in [[[inf weapon damages]]], maybe you can start from there (or correct that and let me copy it to the individual pages)--
 * Level up NPC's and load them out (we can do that to with your permission)

  * --Iquilah and Lug have a different name in their url's and page, which is correct?-- (renamed, went by the ones you used in thread ~Dino)
 * LATER (when mission is started and stuff) (WHAT? THIS HELLISH NIGHTMARE EVENTUALLY ENDS?!)
  * Play Stellaris (OMG IT DOES! OH YES! YES! PLEASE!)
  * Relax (SO MUCH YES, OMG I LOVE YOU)
  * Write a page on the layer system so Dino can write the Program of Legendsâ„¢
  * Specify recharge time (in turns or layers) for energy based weapons (for the same reason)
  * Add other armoury things: (NEVERMIND, SCREW YOU, YOU'RE EVIL) (>:D ~Dino)
   * Atomic Hammer
   * Tank Drone
   * Combot
   * CERNIN
   * Replace infantry respec with mech suit (Corn also had [http://forums.ltheory.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=4692&start=135#p119803 a thing] about the mech thing, this should prolly be in before mission 3 since Corn wants one)
   * Ship specialisation (can wait, don't think anyone wants/can afford this right now)
   * [[[equip:High Tier Weapons CraftKit]]]
   * [[[equip:High Tier Weapons PartKit]]]
   * rebalance high tier kit prices (can wait)
  * Ponder over the stuff in [[[http://lt-rekt.wikidot.com/armory-to-add-list#toc36 | "Maybe"]]] and add or remove as needed
  * Read the [http://forums.ltheory.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=4933 Character Stories], take notes and decide what's canon and what's not, or something.
  * Make a correct version of the tree on [[[alien abilities]]] there was something wrong with 6 and 7 of tier 2 iirc
  * Go through all infantry weapons and add armor penetration to the ones that are lacking it (people can just ask you about the ones they're interested in for now and we can add one by one)
  * Fix [[[equip:Blunderbuss]]] - add new fun stuff, remove old dumb stuff ((have looked it over and decided that I can't really think of anything else to add just yet, and outlander's insta-stick globs need heavily balanced anyway because they're basically a one-shot-kill god weapon at the moment ~Tal)) ((okay, we have enough fun stuff for it now anyway
 * AND THEN: for the patreon rewards:
  * We need a thread about Warp drives and their lore (Silverware)
  * we need to fill out the technology page(s)? (Cha0zz)
  * --Need more work on the Mimir Corporation page (Charley)--
  * Need to give Victor his own major character page (Victor)
  * --Whatever you feel like :V if you're starved for ideas, perhaps Tartarus history? If that's not too much spoilers (~Dino)--
  * I owe you guys pictures. GIVE ME PICTURE SUGGESTIONS SO I KNOW WHAT TO MAKE
   * The Tartarus? Too big? :V (~Dino)    Yeah, definitely. Can't possibly manage that in three hours. ._. (~Tal) Maybe finish the boarbear thing you started a while back? That looked quite done back then and we have no shiny image for it on the wiki (~Dino)  You keep picking the most complicated projects. xD (~Tal) woops >.> How about nice renders of the HAMMER and/or ShieldMaiden and/or Carrier? I know you have the models, but the renders we have I had to cut out of some image I found on your imgur and are kinda lo-res and tiny (or non-existant for the HAMMER) (~Dino)
   * Some stuff on the  technology needs pictures (HAMMER, boarbear?, quantum mini-turret, quantum minidrone) (~Cha0zz)
   * Maybe it would be cool if we also started to add models for the weapons? (~Cha0zz)
